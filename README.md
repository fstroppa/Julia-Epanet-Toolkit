# Introduction

EPANET is a program that analyzes the hydraulic and water quality behavior of water distribution systems, developed
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA). The EPANET Programmer's Toolkit is a dynamic link library (DLL)
of functions that allows developers to customize EPANET's computational engine for their  own specific needs.

# Description

The Julia-Epanet-Toolkit is an open-source software, developed to provide a programming interface with the high-level
Julia Programming Language. The goal of the Julia-Epanet-Toolkit is to serve as a common programming framework for 
development and research in the field of smart water networks. The project does not cover the graphical user interface
